  I enjoy how drama movies focus on the personal development and choices of
  their characters. The acting in drama movies is usually top-notch, with actors
  delivering complex and nuanced performances that bring the story to life. I
  love seeing talented actors at their best.

  I love how romantic movies highlight the deep emotional connections between
  characters, making me believe in the power of love and the idea that soulmates
  can exist.

<h3>Spirited Away</h3>

  Spirited Away beautifully captures Chihiro's emotional growth. Watching her go
  from a scared, uncertain girl to a brave, resourceful young woman is inspiring
  and relatable for viewers of all ages.
